In this project, we are trying to underdsand if there is a relationship between chronic health and the economical dimension of the population ability to own or rent a house. We will gather information of the health data from the 2020-2021 survey of the state of NYC; a subset data of the survey responses conducted by the CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System(BRFSS). We will then visualise, and compare the data of the main variables of interest in this dataset, which are the health component: 'PHYSHLTH' and the economic component: 'RENTHOM1'. Finally, we will conduct some statistical tests that will help us interpret and confirm our results.
